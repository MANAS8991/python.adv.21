    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function or a description that defines the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random experiment or process. It provides a set of probabilities associated with each possible outcome, indicating the relative likelihood of observing each outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the values in a probability distribution may represent random events or variables, the distribution itself is not random. It describes the probabilities or likelihoods of different outcomes based on certain assumptions or data. The distribution can be determined based on empirical observations, theoretical models, or a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using probability distributions, we can make predictions or inferences about the likelihood of specific outcomes or events occurring. These predictions are based on the underlying probability distribution and statistical principles. While individual outcomes may be random and unpredictable, the overall behavior of a large number of events or observations follows the patterns described by the probability distribution."

They are considered to be truly random as their values cannot be determined or predicted in advance. True random number generation is typically achieved through specialized hardware devices or external environmental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms. These algorithms use a seed value as an initial input and produce a sequence of numbers that appear to be random. While the generated sequence is not truly random, it exhibits statistical properties that closely resemble randomness. Pseudo-random numbers are generated by computers and software, making them repeatable given the same seed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many practical purposes because they exhibit randomness properties that are sufficient for most applications. They pass statistical tests for randomness and can effectively model random processes in simulations, generate cryptographic keys, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and more. However, they are not suitable for applications that require true randomness, such as encryption schemes that require strong unpredictability. In those cases, true random number sources are needed."

The majority of people would have heights close to the mean, and as you move further away from the mean in either direction, the number of individuals gradually decreases.\n",
